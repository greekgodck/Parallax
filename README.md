NOTE:
1.I created this template to test The Parallax Effect, Multi-level Drop Down Menu and Overlay Effect on Images.
2.The Banner Image is approx 19MB(Too Large for a webpage), which is why I have put a pre-loader.
3.I have applied both Parallex Effect and Fixed Background Image so as to one can experience both.
4.Do check out the Overlay effect in the Project Section. Made use of attr.
5.Fuly responsive. i.e. has media query for both Mobile and PC. Its a Mobile-First design.
6.Animations have been Disabled.
